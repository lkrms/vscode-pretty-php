> This extension integrates the latest release of [pretty-php][] with Visual
> Studio Code.

`pretty-php` is a code formatter for PHP in the tradition of [Black][] for
Python, [Prettier][] for JavaScript and [shfmt][] for shell scripts. It aims to
bring the benefits of fast, deterministic, minimally configurable, automated
code formatting tools to PHP development.

To that end, you can also use `pretty-php` as a standalone tool, or pair it with
a linter like [phpcbf][] or [php-cs-fixer][] and add it to your CI workflows.

Or you could just give it a try and [let me know what you think][discuss]. ðŸ˜‰

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4, 8.0, 8.1 or 8.2 with the standard `tokenizer`, `mbstring` and `json`
  extensions enabled

## Features

Code is formatted for

1. readability,
2. consistency, and
3. small diffs

and with a few [pragmatic exceptions][]:

- previous formatting is ignored
- whitespace is changed, code is not
- output is the same no matter how input is formatted

Also:

- Entire files are formatted in place
- Configuration is optional
- Formatting options are deliberately limited
- Uses PHP's tokenizer to parse input and validate output
- Checks formatted and original code for equivalence
- Supports code written for PHP versions up to 8.2 (when running on a PHP
  version that can parse it)
- Compliant with [PSR-12][] and [PER][] if "Formatting: Psr12" is enabled
  (details [here][docs/PSR-12.md] and [here][PSR-12 issue])
